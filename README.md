# Python Decorator Learning

All the times, I have seen decorators into different parts of programms. I would always become curious about their characteristics. "What are they?", "What is special about them?", "Can I make my own decorators?" etc.

Now, I am learning about them. I think, I will be able to get most of my answers and also decorators will be inherent part of my code.
